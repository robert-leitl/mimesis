Mimesis is a web experiment which uses your webcam to assign your facial expressions to one of six emotions (<em>fear, anger, happiness, surprise, sadness and neutral</em>). It then tries to imitate these emotions with different parameters on the geometry and texture of an alien like orb. Additionally, procedural sound emphazise the different emotions. It is implemented mainly using Three.js, TFJS, Tone.js and tweakpane.
